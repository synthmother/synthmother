- 👋 Hi, I’m Cleo (@synthmother)!!
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her or they/them
- 👀 I’m interested in game development, low-level programming, parallel computing, and physics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Bevy/Rust.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on indie game development and cool open source projects!
- 📫 How to reach me: feel free to email me at cleo.mikeska@proton.me
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm kinda nasty at the bass guitar but I've never been in a band! >_<

My friend and I are currently workshopping ideas for cool video games which I intend to document and aggregate here. If you're interested in following these projects we'd love it if you stuck around! We promise they will be fun :3
